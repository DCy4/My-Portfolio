        <p>
            Welcome to my personal space! I am a new software developer based in USA. With a strong background in healthcare operations, I am dedicated to being the best programmer I can be.

            In my free time, I enjoy learning, coding and playing soccer among other things. I believe in the power of good, and I am always eager to learn and help others along the way.
